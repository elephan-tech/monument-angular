        <h4>Rise and Shine</h4>
        <p>
          Students receive a personal wake-up and eat a family-style breakfast
          with their Houseparent and Student Life Family. Students share a
          personal daily goal with their family and head to advisory for
          community building and DBT skills practice. After advisory, the
          students move to through their daily class schedule.

        <h4>Morning Focus</h4>
        <p>
          Well-being is weaved throughout all aspects of our program. Every
          morning, students and staff practice mindfulness and engage in a group
          lesson around important social skills. The morning block sets students
          up for a focused, successful day.

        <h4>Academic Blocks</h4>
        <p>
          Students have daily academic blocks with a maximum of a 1:15 adult to
          student ratio, focusing on Literacy and Humanities, Math, and Science.
          Between these blocks, students have a social lunch, recess, and
          opportunities for electives such as PE, Health, Performing Arts,
          Instrumental Music and Spanish. Classroom instruction is targeted to
          meet student needs and is designed to provide all students with
          choice, movement, and authentic learning experiences.

        <h4>Student Life Activities</h4>
        <p>
          After the academic day, students engage in enrichment activities that
          might include sports, cooking club, choir, theater, or service clubs.
          Dinner is eaten family-style, then students do their reading homework
          and have time to relax with evening family activities like community
          meetings, board games, or movie night. We provide a warm, home-like
          environment in the boarding program while embedding studentsâ€™
          acquisition of important independent living skills.

        <h4>Closing the Day</h4>
        <p>
          Before students prepare for bed, they reflect on the daily goal they
          set in the morning. The Houseparent and the other students in the
          family celebrate and support one another in this process. Students
          then read or journal in their rooms until lights out.

        <h4>Drop-off and Pickup</h4>
        <p>
          Early Sunday evening, students are dropped off and families have a
          chance to speak with staff. The same opportunity exists on Friday
          afternoon when students are picked up for the weekend. The purpose of
          a structured drop-off and pick-up is to establish and develop
          relationships with caregivers and to keep lines of communication open
          to ensure a seamless transition between home and school life.
