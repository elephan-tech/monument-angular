//     content: `<p>WASHINGTON — As the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, school leaders are meeting to plan what’s next for education. Shannon Hodge is the founding executive director of the D.C. Charter School Alliance and said the path forward looks different at each school, but one thing is certain: social distancing is here to stay for a while.</p>
// <p>“It’s not going to be just flipping on a switch, we will have to relearn how to be in spaces together,” she said. “Recovery is not going to be as quick as getting here was, it is going to take us a while to really get back to where we were fully and so for many that's likely going to take multiple years.”</p>
// <p>At IDEA Public Charter School, about 30% of its 325 students are learning in-person in socially distanced classrooms and sometimes even in outdoor tents. School leaders are following a timeline from InstructionPartners.org that indicates the new normal will be in the 2023-2024 school year. For IDEA, that means two years of hybrid learning. </p>
// <p>At the much smaller Monument Academy PCS, CEO Dr. Jefferey Grant expects 90% of the 94 students to return to the boarding middle school in August 2021. Monument will be piloting a 12-month education model next school year, broken into trimesters with remediation breaks in between. </p>
// <p>“So, we're not waiting until June or July to address those deficits and deficiencies,” Grant said, noting that the pandemic has forced educators to reimage schools and how they serve students. “The current education system has not been benefiting everybody, and we must do something about it." </p>
// <p>Grant said it's focusing on learning loss, investing in smaller class sizes that cater to social distancing and finding creative ways to make the hybrid model work for those students in-person and virtual.</p>
// <p>“The school leaders who are trying to put together plans, they're putting together 1,000 piece puzzles every day,” explained Hodge, “they get a new piece of information that changes the whole puzzle, and they've got to go back and start over again.”</p>`,

//     WASHINGTON (ABC7) — Monument Academy Public Charter school in Northeast DC decided to try something different. It became a boarding school for a dozen middle school students who needed more attention because of their special ed status, or their coming from large families with limited resources.
//     </p>
//     <p>
//     The object was twofold: give them the extra help they need to succeed academically and keep them COVID free.
//     </p>
//     <p>
//     Since the first week in October, the students have spent 24/7 in the school building. Like a hundred or so other students at Monument, they take their instruction via laptop computers or tablets. The difference here is the staffers also serve as coaches to help the young people who may have trouble understanding something presented in their virtual classes.
//     </p>
//     <p>
//     And CEO Jeffery Grant says, so far, no student or staffer has tested positive for COVID.
//     </p>
//     <p>
//     “Make sure they have social and emotional supports to keep them steady and level during this pandemic,” Grant said.
//     </p>
//       <p>
//       Twelve-year-old Krystal Moore says she’s learning.
//     </p>
//       <p>
//       “Academically, it's fun. I love all my classes and it’s just plain fun,” she said.
//     </p>
//       <p>
//       They released the students today for Thanksgiving break which will end November 30. The school leaders said they will test the students for COVID a few days before they return.
//     </p>
//     <p>
//     The program has become popular enough, they’re talking about doubling the number of students participating.

// <p>The dinner I shared recently in Washington, D.C., with Paul and Joy Langmaid, a married couple in their 30s, and four of the girls with whom they live, was remarkable in many ways.</p>
// <p>For one thing, the girls were much more respectful and well behaved than I’d expect of young teens. One began the meal by leading a prayer (“God is good. God is great. We thank You for our food.”). Another, finding her mac and cheese with a side of broccoli lukewarm, politely asked Paul, “May you please put this in the microwave?”</p>
// <p>But the most remarkable thing about the dinner was that the setting, the meal, and everyone involved were part of a bold experiment in how to educate some of our nation’s most disadvantaged, traumatized, and at-risk kids.</p>
// <p>The dinner was at <a href="https://monumentacademy.org/">Monument Academy Public Charter School</a> in northeast D.C., one of just a tiny handful of urban charter boarding schools in the country. The girls are seventh- and eighth-grade students who live at the school on weekdays. Paul and Joy Langmaid are their house parents.</p>
// <p>Monument Academy, founded in 2015, is still relatively new, but already the results are impressive: of current 8th graders who started in fifth grade (who when they first enrolled were on average 3.3 grade levels behind in reading and 2.8 grade levels behind in math), 44 percent are at grade level in reading and 20 percent more have narrowed the gap; the percentage of students reaching grade level in math has doubled, with 20 percent more closing the gap. Moreover, Monument students’ emotional growth and social skills have improved markedly.</p>
// <p>Could a similar effort—an urban charter boarding school—work in Rochester?</p>
// <p>That same evening I shared dinner with the Langmaids and the students, I also spoke with Emily Bloomfield, Monument’s CEO and co-founder. I asked her about the costs, challenges, and rewards of a public boarding school and whether the model might work in a midsize city like Rochester. An edited version of that interview appears below—as well as my conversation on the subject with Donna Marie Cozine, co-founder and chief educational officer of Rochester’s Renaissance Academy Charter School of the Arts—but first some more about Bloomfield and Monument Academy.</p>
// <p>Bloomfield’s background includes economics, public administration, and a hands-on knowledge of public schools. In California, she served as an elected member and president of the Santa Monica-Malibu Board of Education, and then in D.C. as a member of the DC Public Charter School Board. She has a B.A. from the University of Chicago, a master’s in public administration from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University and a post-graduate degree in economics from Oxford University. She and her husband, Byron Auguste, an economist who served in the Obama White House, have three children.</p>
// <p>In co-founding Monument Academy, Bloomfield’s focus was on children who have been involved in foster care or at risk of entering the foster care system. They may be homeless or have experienced domestic violence, abuse or neglect, or have a parent who is incarcerated or has addiction issues.</p>
// <p>Students touched by the foster care system, Bloomfield learned, move or change schools an average of two to three times a year, are behind their peers academically and emotionally are twice as likely to drop out of high school. Only about 2 percent ever earn a four-year college degree. Bloomfield’s solution was daring: take children from some of the poorest sections of the city—84 percent of Monument students that first year had current or prior contact with foster care, 100 percent qualified for free or reduced meals, and one-third started the year at kindergarten or first grade reading level—and provide a 24-hour learning environment and the stability of a safe and nurturing place to live.</p>
// <p>Her plan also took advantage of an unusual feature of D.C.’s education law that offers extra funding to schools that provide housing to their students. (This is why another non-profit, <a href="https://www.seedfoundation.com/">the SEED Foundation</a>, began its own public boarding experiment in D.C. The SEED school was profiled on “<a href="https://vimeo.com/90222724">60 Minutes</a>” and featured in the movie “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2SZE8IA9RA">Waiting for Superman.</a>” SEED has since opened schools in Baltimore and Miami, where education laws were amended to cover costs of student housing.)</p>
// <p>With additional financial support from major foundations, Monument launched operations, acquiring a former elementary school building in northeast D.C. In the first year, the school enrolled 40 fifth-grade students. To address students’ mental health issues, they hired almost as many therapists and counselors as teachers. Since then, Monument has expanded one grade each year and today serves 130 students in fifth through eighth grades. Boarding allows not only for enhanced academics but also for extensive after-school activities including sports, Girl Scouts, dance, cooking, art, book and chess clubs.</p>
// <p>During the school week, students live in single-gender dorm-like apartments of up to 10 kids with house parents, usually a married couple (and sometimes the couple’s children and pets). Students sleep in bunk beds in shared bedrooms. There’s a communal kitchen and living room, shared bathrooms for students, and two bedrooms and a private bathroom for the house parents.</p>
// <p>Family-style living allows house parents to teach social skills. In addition to sharing and emotion-control, this includes specific skills.</p>
// <p>“Students earn points for speaking politely and not arguing,” house parent Paul Langmaid says. “They also learn to introduce themselves when they meet people and shake hands while looking the person in the eye.”</p>
// <p>The evening I visited, all the girls I met did exactly that. With enough points, Paul explains, students gain privileges, such as choosing which chores they want to do: sink, counters, table or mopping.</p>
// <p>Students live in the school homes from Sunday evening through Friday afternoon, and then go home for the weekend to their foster families, parents, or guardians.</p>
// <p>At dinner that evening, I ask the girls how it felt to leave Monument Academy and go home for the weekend. Immediately, two begin singing in unison—and with big smiles—the spiritual, “Oh, Freedom!”</p>
// <p>“What freedom is it that you like so much on the weekends?” I ask.</p>
// <p>“To eat real food,” they say, laughing, “go to bed when we want and get up when we want, and listen to the music we want.”</p>
// <p>Clearly, Monument had succeeded in teaching them social skills without dampening their spirit or senses of humor.</p>
// <p>In Rochester today, a dozen or so <a href="https://www.goodschoolsroc.org/schools/">public charter schools </a>serve about 6,100 students, or nearly 18 percent of the school population. The schools vary in terms of location, academic emphasis and culture, but I’m not aware of any that has a residential component.</p>
// <p>In my discussion with Bloomfield, we explored issues involved with charter boarding schools and whether the model could potentially benefit some Rochester students. Here is an edited version of our conversation:</p>
// <p><strong>There are some 7,000 charter schools in the country today that enroll nearly 3.2 million students, but only a handful of charters include boarding? Why isn’t it more common?  </strong></p>
// <p>Well, there are lots of private boarding schools, of course—always have been. But it’s very difficult to do this as a public school. There are cost considerations and it’s very complex work with significant risks. And a big factor is fear of failure. In education there’s a huge fear of failure and therefore a high degree of tolerance of known failure and a huge aversion to unknown failure—even if the risk of failure might lead to better outcomes.</p>
// <p><strong>Have you been afraid of failure at Monument?</strong></p>
// <p>Everyday I’m afraid of failure. But that’s just part of the work I have to do. If helping kids is something we care about, which I do, we can each pick different ways of doing it. This is the way I pick because I just can’t look at society’s failures every day—deep poverty and the stresses it brings—and think that part of my life didn’t involve addressing it.</p>
// <p><strong>Could a midsize city like Rochester, N.Y., be suitable for a charter boarding school?</strong></p>
// <p>It’s a question of need. Do you have kids who are homeless, living in shelters, temporary housing, or with guardians or extended family—couch-surfing but not in a permanent home? Do you have kids with an incarcerated parent or a parent struggling with substance abuse or mental illness? Do you have kids who have been removed from their families into the foster system or who are at risk of removal, and do you want to prevent that?</p>
// <p><strong>The annual cost per-pupil for a child at Monument Academy is nearly $60,000—nearly three times the typical cost for a regular city student. Could a smaller community realistically afford that?</strong></p>
// <p>Well, it’s important to have a funding formula (from the city) that includes the residential piece. It’s unusual to have this, but it can be added by legislation. That’s what recently happened in Miami with the SEED school there. Also, half our students have IEPs (individual education programs) due to behavioral or other disabilities so that’s up to 40 percent of the cost per student. A lot of the cost is for personnel to address special needs—special ed coordinators, counselors, therapists, small classes. You’re going to pay that regardless of where the student is enrolled. But you also need to ask: what’s the cost of not doing it? Certainly in D.C., there’s a lot of money spent in poorly delivered services with the same results, which is failure. We hope to demonstrate better and better outcomes for kids that help makes the case for funding in other communities because the cost of not offering this—dropping out, winding up in the juvenile justice system, which is the biggest predictor of incarceration as an adult—that cost is estimated to be $245,000.</p>
// <p><strong>Thinking of a school in Rochester, could they ever do this without the kind of major philanthropic support Monument receives?</strong></p>
// <p>If a donor were able to provide the residential building, I think you could do a lot with whatever the regular revenue is and then top it off with donations for boarding.</p>
// <p><strong>Could an existing charter school add a residential program?</strong></p>
// <p>Sure, they would just have to amend their charter. In fact, before I started this I put out some feelers to some charters here to see if there was any interest, but there wasn’t. They have their model and they’re sticking to it. “Good luck,” they said, and “Oh, by the way, we have some students for you!”</p>
// <p><strong>House parents are a key to making the boarding program work. Who have you found, over the years, is attracted to these jobs?  </strong></p>
// <p>People who have done house parenting. It’s like its own world and the ones who turn out best, for them it’s a career choice and a lifestyle; they feel called to do it.</p>
// <p><strong>Do you ever get complaints that by having students live with house parents—which in practice resembles a traditional family—you’re imposing middle class values on these kids?  </strong></p>
// <p>We’re not passing judgment on families by offering our students another experience. We have a high percentage of African-American staff working directly with the kids as role models and we work to validate the kids’ and their families’ experiences as worthwhile.</p>
// <p>This is something we offer and there are benefits to it. During the school week here, your child will sleep, have good nutrition, live a particular way, learn cooking skills, and have other opportunities. Our house parents let kids know that is the way we do it at school, but when you go home or into your neighborhood you may do things differently: you may eat dinner at different hours and in different ways, and you’ll need to navigate your neighborhood. Later, when you go into the workplace, there’ll be another way of doing things so learning to navigate different worlds is part of being successful.</p>
// <p><strong>Do you offer what is sometimes called “values education”?</strong></p>
// <p>Yes. The values are core values of kindness, integrity, mindfulness, and positivity. Also being honest, owning up if you make a mistake, and apologizing. Managing emotions is important, too: a lot of our kids can easily feel angered or triggered by something. What are my coping techniques? How do I recognize the feelings I’m having and learn to manage them? These are important to emotional life and well-being and are not attributes of any particular culture</p>
// <p><strong>What gives you most satisfaction about the residential piece?</strong></p>
// <p>School is work, but with the boarding you see kids form relationships, learn to problem solve, and acquire new skills like preparing meals, and even reading to the houseparent’s child. Knowing they have that breathing space to relax and have fun and grow—that’s rewarding.</p>
// <p><strong>Would you like to see more residential charters around the country?</strong></p>
// <p>I would. There are so many things we’ve learned: things we’ve done well and mistakes we’ve made. I’d love to be able to provide in-house residential training for school leaders, teachers, and others. They can actually come here and have a lived experience— you’ve got to live it.</p>
// <p>After my visit to Monument Academy, I spoke by phone with Donna Marie Cozine, co-founder and chief educational officer of <a href="http://www.renecad.org/">Renaissance Academy Charter School of the Arts.</a></p>
// <p>Founded in 2014 with its campus in Greece, Renaissance offers kindergarten through sixth grades and serves about 460 students, more than 90 percent of them from the city of Rochester.</p>
// <p>I was curious, given Cozine’s experience in running a charter school in Rochester, what she thought of the boarding model.</p>
// <p>“Charters began as a place for innovation,” she says, “and I think it’s wonderful that some places can do that by having boarding schools. If you had that model here, I think you could certainly fill the seats, but you’d have to sit down and look at the funding stream.</p>
// <p>“In New York State we get 68 percent of the money that districts spend on their own pupils. Can you make the model function on that? You need wrap-around staff, 24 hours a day. You’d have to figure in the extra building space for sleeping, plus dinner—breakfast, lunch and snacks are covered, but not dinner. I do think there’d have to be a quite a bit of philanthropy to get up and running and to sustain it. But it’s a very interesting idea and if anyone in the community wanted to consider starting one, I’d be happy to sit around the table and be thought partners with them.”</p>

//       content: `<p>They number in the millions and they often are hidden in plain sight.  There are 1.3 million students who are homeless in American schools, yet many fear the stigma of sharing their vulnerability with their peers and teachers, making the provision of supports more difficult for those who most need it.  The risks of perpetuating the cycle of homelessness and poverty are high.</p>
// <p>Homeless students have among the lowest graduation rates in the nation and failing to graduate from high school is the leading risk factor for becoming homeless as an adult.   The combination of high school dropout and homelessness is a double threat to everything a young person might want to achieve in life.  While complex, the student homelessness challenge is a solvable one and there are models across the nation that inspire.  One is Monument Academy Public Charter School in Washington, DC.</p>
// <p>Walk the halls of Monument Academy and you see order, respect, and even inspiration.  Students are dressed in uniforms, greet one another and teachers by name, and are surrounded by uplifting messages on school walls.  One message says, “We can push through anything we put our minds to”; another, “Don’t go through life, grow through life.”   The words that come to mind to describe the school culture are “love with structure and discipline.”</p>
// <p>What’s remarkable are both the student population at Monument and the school model designed to ensure every one of them has the supports they need to stay on track.   Monument is a weekday boarding school for the highest risk students and their families enmeshed in different systems – foster care, juvenile justice, trauma-impacted and more.  Thirty-five percent of students at Monument Academy are homeless in a city whose homeless crisis has doubled since 2014.  Couples who serve as surrogate parents during the week house and support students at Monument with everything from homework to healthy meals to counseling.</p>
// <p>Schools like Monument can be pillars of stability for students whose lives are chaotic and traumatic– and a model for the nation.  Schools such as Monument can help in at least three ways.</p>
// <p>First, schools are increasingly recognizing that personalized education that deliberately fosters the social and emotional well being of children leads to better outcomes.  Addressing the needs of the whole child helps keep students in school and on track.</p>
// <p>Second, schools are in a strong position to provide and broker the necessary wrap around services that homeless students and their peers often need.  Addressing trauma, mental health challenges, and other practical life issues like food insecurity, lack of a stable place to do homework, and transportation requires a dedicated team of teachers, counselors, clinicians and homeless liaisons who work seamlessly together.  The liaison at Monument brokers supports that include finding stable housing, ensuring regular meals, and facilitating mental health supports for homeless students.</p>
// <p>Third, schools can go big and bold and offer weekday boarding with a high return on investment.  Monument cites things such as providing washing machines so students don’t feel stigmatized by unclean clothes; two caring adults around the clock who house the students onsite and act as surrogates; and a predictable place to sleep, eat nutritious food, and experience extended day enrichment.  Higher academic attainment, reduced need for special education services, increased graduation rates and better outcomes in postsecondary education and employment all offset the higher initial cost for schools.</p>
// <p>The National Commission on Social, Emotional and Academic Development released a unanimous report from top scientists highlighting the latest evidence: “Children with stronger social and emotional competencies are also more likely to enter and graduate from college, succeed in their careers, have positive work and family relationships, better mental and physical health, reduced criminal behavior, and to become engaged citizens.”</p>
// <p>Places like Monument Academy that educate and support the whole child are showing the nation what can be achieved.  At a time when student homelessness is on the rise, schools can be places of stability and inspiration that unleash a generation of young people from the most vulnerable circumstances to reach for the American Dream.</p> `,

//       content: `<p >It’s dinnertime at the Langmaids. Just four of their eight girls are home on this Thursday night in October, so things are relatively calm. Relatively.</p>
// <p>Home is a third-story suite at Monument Academy, the charter boarding school in Washington, D.C., where Paul and Joy Langmaid work as house parents. Their “kids” are seven middle school girls with varying levels of social and emotional challenges from some city, and their own 3-year-old daughter, Micaela. When I walk into the home — the term that’s purposefully used at Monument — I’m greeted by Paul and the family dogs, Midas and Lucy. In the kitchen, where there’s debate raging over whether to prepare ravioli or something, as one of the girls puts it, less “gross,” I say hi to a seventh-grader, who ignores me and retreats into the bedroom that she shares with a roommate. Langmaid excuses himself and follows her. A few seconds later they emerge, and K. (her first initial) walks up to me with her right hand extended.</p>
// <p>“Nice to meet you,” she says, a shy smile creeping onto her face.</p>
// <p>Such is life at Monument, an innovative school that is attempting to educate — in all senses of the word — some of Washington’s most traumatized children. More than 80 percent of the school’s 130 students have been involved in the child welfare system — including foster care or temporary removal from their homes — at some point in their lives, and data show that they are half as likely to graduate from high school on time as their peers. On average they have attended at least three schools prior to Monument, but none of them has attended a school <em>like </em>Monument, where the overwhelming majority of students live during the week. (All students go home on the weekend, to their foster families, parents, or caretakers.)</p>
// <p>“There aren’t many schools that work with this population of students,” says Head of School Denise Miles, Ed.M.&#8217;05, who’s been at Monument since it opened four years ago. “We have the opportunity to really influence all aspects of a student’s life. When I was a high school principal, I often said if I could just rent the house across the street and give them a place that’s stable and quiet, where they can do homework and not have to worry about taking care of siblings or what’s going on in the neighborhood or anything else, then we could really move them further faster. Here we can be working on life skills with them, and they’re getting counseling, and house parents are doing academic support in the evening. They’re learning 24 hours a day.”</p>
// <p>The lesson right now is one of socialization and manners. K. listens to Langmaid and alters her behavior both because he and his wife have established a culture of respect in the household, and because she wants to rack up core values points.</p>
// <p>“We earn them by being kind to one another, being respectful to their daughter, the dogs, the house, and doing what we’re supposed to do,” another girl tells me.</p>
// <p>When I ask about their favorite snack food, three girls answer in chorus: “Ice cream!”</p>
// <p>Allowing kids to scarf down a bowl of cookies and cream after school is a brave move for any parent, let alone one living with a basketball team-worth of middle-schoolers.</p>
// <p>“They know if they can’t handle their sugar, then they can’t buy ice cream anymore,” Paul Langmaid says. “We’ve had a couple of girls that tried and failed, and that’s okay.”</p>
// <p><strong>Mo</strong><strong>numen</strong><strong>t Academy </strong>is the brainchild of Emily Bloomfield, an economist who served as an elected member of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District Board of Education, and later on the D.C. Public Charter School Board. It stemmed from a personal situation she encountered in which her aunt and uncle-in-law took custody of their two young grandchildren.</p>
// <p>She wondered what their futures would hold if they entered the foster care system or were adopted, so she began examining statistics. What she found horrified her. Students in the foster care system move homes one and a half to two times a year, destroying relationships with friends and teachers; they’re twice as likely to drop out of high school; and only 2 percent earn four-year college degrees.</p>
// <p>“I thought that was not acceptable,” Bloomfield says. “Considering that roughly 25,000 kids age out of foster care every year [in the United States], and it will cost the government $8 billion for the next six years of their lives, it’s a staggering waste of money but an even more staggering waste of lives. I began to think, Is this an inevitability?”</p>
// <p>She started researching what does work for children in foster care, and discovered that personalized education and a relationship with a caring adult are key. Life skills that they often miss, like cooking and financial literacy, also are important.</p>
// <p>Bloomfield put together a white paper and shared it with educators, policy experts, and legal advocates around Washington. Her idea was based loosely on the Milton Hershey School, but unlike the renowned Pennsylvania institution, she designed Monument to be a weekday-only boarding school, in part to avoid the appearance of institutionalization, and in part to get buy-in from parents and caretakers. She and cofounder Marlene Magrino submitted the school’s charter application in February 2014, and it was approved that May. After a year of planning the school opened for fifth-graders in August 2015. It’s added a grade each year since, and now has fifth through eighth. As a charter school, it receives extra financial support from the city, and is around 90 percent publicly funded.</p>
// <p>According to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, about 3.2 million students attend 7,000 charter schools in 44 states plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Despite that, says Kay Merseth, M.A.T.&#8217;69, Ed.D.&#8217;82, a senior lecturer at Harvard and former director of the Ed School’s Teacher Education Program, the popularity of charter schools has been waning in recent years.</p>
// <p>“There was tremendous growth, and they’ve run into a little bit of a buzz saw with people suggesting that they’re re-segregating the schools,” she says. “I get pretty frustrated with the criticism because the good ones are trying to provide an alternative for kids who have lousy choices.”</p>
// <p>That was exactly Bloomfield’s aim. Creating Monument outside of the charter school framework would have been an impossibility, she believes.</p>
// <p>“Charter schools are meant to be places where you can incubate an idea and try a really new thing,” she says. “We never could have done this in a traditional public school setting because of the whole idea of boarding and using our budget in such discretionary ways. Our first year we did so much revising of schedules, job descriptions, programming, all these things that are really hard to do when you’re working in a more [rigid structure]. We could be really nimble.”</p>
// <p>Bloomfield envisioned a school that enrolled a high number of students in foster care, but there’s been a movement in Washington away from placing kids into that system. In June 2016, D.C.’s Child and Family Services reported 1,020 kids in out-of-home placement, compared to 1,676 four years earlier.</p>
// <p>“Some of the outcome data around foster care is shocking because you think, Oh, if we get the kids out then they’re going to do better,” says Shane Mulhern, Ed.M.&#8217;02, Monument’s president. “But unless they’re in physical or sexual jeopardy in terms of abuse, it’s better to keep them with the parents. They do far better. The reality is family is family. There’s an important skill to be gained by having to navigate the family dynamic.”</p>
// <p><strong>Ho</strong><strong>used in a former </strong>elementary school less than two miles from the U.S. Capitol, Monument has already threatened to outgrow its physical space. Narrow halls mean students (70 percent of whom are male) are sometimes too close for comfort, which can lead to confrontations. Despite the fact that words like “kindness” and “mindfulness” are painted on the otherwise sparsely decorated white hallway walls, violence is a reality here. Mulhern was punched by a student last year. Another tried to stab Miles with scissors.</p>
// <p>“Adolescents in general know exactly where your buttons are and will poke them on purpose to elicit a response,” Miles says. “But our kids are especially skilled at that and often are looking for the conflict because that’s what they’re used to.”</p>
// <p>Still, both stress that aggressive behavior is a manifestation of trauma, not the core of who a child is. Dealing with disruptive situations, even in classes that average only 12 students, is difficult. Staffing has been among Monument’s biggest challenges.</p>
// <p>“Finding people who can do this kind of work is tough. It is not how teachers have traditionally been trained,” says Mulhern, who previously worked at the U.S. Department of Education as director of the Investing in Innovation Fund. “Part of my job is developing partnerships and residency programs where we can have individuals come in and build their capacity to create a pipeline for ourselves, but also a pipeline where folks can go do this in other schools. But I don’t have a simple answer in terms of the people and the training. We are living in it and figuring it out.”</p>
// <p>As Mulhern gives me a tour of the academic space, afterschool activities like sports, dance, cooking, and chess are taking place. During the week, Monument students almost never stop learning. Among the staff of more than 100 are 11 on the well-being team, which provides behavioral, emotional, and therapeutic support. In addition to their academic curriculum, every student at Monument receives two hours of weekly instruction on mindfulness, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance.</p>
// <p>In the third-floor student wellness lounge, complete with beanbag chairs, an exercise bike, and colorfully painted walls, Mulhern stresses the importance of the school’s psychologists, counselors, and social workers.</p>
// <p>“There’s so much we don’t know in terms of supporting students who have had adverse life experiences,” he says. “Running a $1.5 billion initiative at the Department of Education is a cakewalk compared to this. It is humbling every day. But I have never worked with a more talented, committed group of adults. This team and what they do on a day-to-day basis and what they’re willing to do for children, they’re the heroes of this work.”</p>
// <p>Because the school is relatively new, lots of outcome data is not available. But its 85 percent retention rate is impressive considering its enrollment is more than 50 percent special needs, as compared to about 12 percent in most other charter schools, Mulhern says. Homelessness is also a growing problem. Perhaps as a result of gentrification in Washington, about 35 percent of Monument’s students this year are homeless (which includes living in a hotel, shelter, or with relatives).</p>
// <p>“These kids have experienced a lot of trauma in their lives, so the challenge is creating a structured academic environment that caters to their specific challenges because trauma presents differently in each individual student,” says Zenon Mills, who teaches fifth- and sixth-grade special education. “I had a student who, the first time he saw me, said I was his favorite teacher ever. I have another student who, no matter what I do, it’s incredibly difficult for me to connect to him on a one-to-one level. He needs a lot more social reinforcement. And that’s pretty standard — seeing that kind of spectrum.”</p>
// <p>He credits the school’s boarding model for providing kids with a stable emotional and social environment that helps them in the classroom. When Mulhern uses his key card to open a door that leads to student life homes, it’s as if we’ve entered a different world. Paintings of palm trees line the walls; welcome home banners decorate front doors. The smell of Italian food wafts through the air.</p>
// <p>Each home comprises a common open space that includes a living room, large dining table, and kitchen. Students share small bedrooms that have bunk beds and the bathrooms are also shared, dorm style. Paid house parents, who are usually a married couple (like the Langmaids) or two individuals, run the household. They have their own room and bathroom within the suite.</p>
// <p>Coexisting with up to 10 middle school students is certainly not a job for those who lack patience. It can be exhausting and emotionally draining, but also quite satisfying. Denise Miles started at Monument as a house parent.</p>
// <p>“It took us several months to build the trust and the culture in our home to where they knew they were safe, they knew nobody was going into their bedroom to mess with them,” she says. “They could come home, relax, do their homework, do different activities. Once you establish that culture in the home, you see the decompression happen, and then you see it during the day as well.”</p>
// <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, students who board more consistently tend to do better at Monument academically than their peers who don’t. (Boarding isn’t required, but it is strongly encouraged and widely done.) Students must read for 30 minutes each night.</p>
// <p>J. is a seventh-grader in her third year at Monument. During the week she lives with the Lang- maids, an arrangement she enjoys.</p>
// <p>“I do miss my mom sometimes, but sometimes we argue and I think it’s better for both of us to have our own space,” she says.</p>
// <p>That students shuttle between two worlds — Monument and their often less-stable home — creates a challenge for house parents like the Langmaids. Their rules and strict structure often don’t exist for the kids outside their home, making for a sometimes rocky readjustment period after the weekend. When the students arrive back on Sunday afternoon, they can be upset because they fought with a family member — or because they enjoyed their time at home and didn’t want to leave.</p>
// <p>At Monument, the challenges for staff are huge; the jobs are so much more than nine-to-five. What makes it worthwhile?</p>
// <p>“One of the students who was in my home is one of our brightest students,” Miles says. “He told me when he was in fifth grade, ‘My second-grade teacher told me I was the angriest person she’d ever met.’ He would upend furniture, run out of the classroom, and he was in fights constantly. He’s an eighth-grader now and hasn’t been in a single fight. They’ll be typical eighth-grade adolescent pushback, but there’s none of that aggression, for the most part” — attributed, she thinks, to the the small, close-knit atmosphere at Monument and to meaningful collaboration with his mother and grandmother. “He’s looking at selective high schools now and really sees himself as a student with the opportunity to do what other good students are doing, which is not the person that he was four years ago.”</p>
// <p>At the Langmaids, K. has transformed in the hour since I arrived. She’s talkative and engaged in the conversation. As I prepare to leave, she thoughtfully thanks me for visiting her home.</p>
// <p>“Thanks for having me,” I reply. “It was a pleasure meeting you.” Then homework continues.</p>

If that response occurs repeatedly or for a prolonged time, it can have lasting effects on children’s developing brains and bodies. They may experience delays in learning, difficulty controlling their emotions, even stunted growth.</p>

// <p>A new, radical approach to serving children who are most at risk for ACEs is being tried at a public charter school in Washington, D.C., called</p>
// <p>. Designed to provide a therapeutic environment for children who are or might soon be in foster care, the school provides weekday boarding in a family-like atmosphere.</p>
// <p>The standard list of ACEs includes emotional or physical neglect or abuse, sexual abuse, and living with an adult who has a substance-abuse problem or mental illness. One study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_Childhood_Experiences_Study" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_Childhood_Experiences_Study">found</a> that 67% of the population had at least one category of ACE and 12.6% had four or more.</p>
// <p>Children from all kinds of families are at risk for ACEs. That study was conducted among a population that was 70% Caucasian and 70% college-educated. But those with greater resources are better able to buffer the adverse effects than those living in poverty.</p>
// <p>The good news is that the effects of toxic stress <em>can </em>be buffered. Children <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deepest-Well-Long-Term-Childhood-Adversity-ebook/dp/B01N7HZ73B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Deepest-Well-Long-Term-Childhood-Adversity-ebook/dp/B01N7HZ73B">can recover</a> if they have adequate sleep and nutrition, the opportunity to practice mindfulness—and, perhaps most crucially, the presence of a caring, stable adult. When the stress is imposed by parents or caregivers themselves—often because they themselves racked up quite a few ACEs and are unable to provide stability as a result—the problem becomes truly challenging.</p>
// <p>To the extent that we’ve tried to solve it, we’ve taken two basic approaches. When parents are unable to provide adequate care, the government places children in foster care. More recently, as educators serving high-poverty populations have become more aware of toxic stress, schools have tried moving to a “<a href="https://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2017/11/22/the-transformative-power-of-trauma-informed-teaching.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2017/11/22/the-transformative-power-of-trauma-informed-teaching.html">trauma-informed</a>” model. When students are disruptive, a school may engage them in a process called <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/blog/restorative-justice-tips-for-schools-fania-davis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.edutopia.org/blog/restorative-justice-tips-for-schools-fania-davis">restorative justice</a> rather than suspending or expelling them. Mental health professionals may be on site.</p>
// <p>But in many cases, neither approach is adequate. Few children <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019074091730213X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019074091730213X">emerge from foster care</a> equipped to lead successful lives. And restorative justice programs can be tricky to implement; some say the pressure to reduce suspensions can lead to chaos—in one case, <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/investigation-in-new-york-city-school-where-a-teenager-was-killed-students-educators-say-lax-discipline-led-to-bullying-chaos-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.the74million.org/article/investigation-in-new-york-city-school-where-a-teenager-was-killed-students-educators-say-lax-discipline-led-to-bullying-chaos-and-death/">even murder</a>.</p>
// <p>Monument Academy has the resources to take a more intensive approach. In its third year, the school enrolled about 100 students in grades five to seven, 83% of whom have some involvement with the city’s Child and Family Services Agency. Next year, when an eighth grade is added, the school will have 150 students—and 105 staff members, some of whom are mental health professionals.</p>
// <p>Students live in apartments in single-sex groups of ten along with a couple of house parents who provide warmth, structure, and predictability—perhaps a bedtime routine of Sleepytime tea and a snack. Classes are small, between two and ten students, and might start with three minutes of mindfulness. If a child feels overwhelmed, she can leave class and chill in a special suite of rooms staffed by a social worker who helps her get back on track.</p>
// <p>When a student acts out, says the school’s director of well-being, Dr. Korrin Saunders, staff are trained to ask “WTF”—which in this case means “What’s the function?” In other words, what purpose is the child’s behavior serving? Given the toxic stress students have experienced, just hearing the word “no” can trigger signals from the brain that lead to a “danger response.”</p>
// <p>Rather than trying to replace students’ families of origin, the staff works to build and maintain connections, texting pictures back and forth during the week. Even when a parent is the source of a child’s trauma, those connections are vital.</p>
// <p>“We’re not saying the families aren’t doing it right,” says co-director of student life Sharyl Dormus, “but just, ‘here’s another way.’”</p>
// <p>Some students have shown marked improvement. Dormus, a house parent herself, recalls one boy who started out spending most of his time “under the table, making animal noises.” Having grown up in the neighborhood, he would run away every chance he got to hang out with gang members. Now, she says, “he’s just blossomed.” He’s started to internalize some of the coping techniques he’s been taught and is able to articulate his feelings when stressed. He takes out the trash on his own—and comes right back.</p>
// <p>Students can still have trouble controlling themselves, but the biggest worry for seventh-graders may be that after next year they’ll be on their own: while the school hopes to expand through twelfth grade, it won’t happen soon enough for them. Principal Denise Miles recalls one boy who was having a meltdown outside her office, cursing the school and various teachers. When he stopped, he mentioned he’d heard of an empty school building that would make a good venue for the planned high school.</p>
// <p>One area where Monument’s success is less clear is academics. With 78% of students reading below grade level when they enter—and a third at kindergarten or first-grade level—the staff has understandably focused largely on reading. But if students are going to be ready for high school, they’ll <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/04/-american-students-reading/557915/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/04/-american-students-reading/557915/">need to acquire knowledge</a> as well. Currently, the curriculum includes no social studies or history, although there are plans to address that.</p>
// <p>With the number of children in foster care <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2017/number-of-children-in-foster-care-continues-to-increase" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2017/number-of-children-in-foster-care-continues-to-increase">rising</a>, partly as a result of the opioid epidemic, more school districts might want to look to Monument as a model—and the school has devoted <a href="https://monumentacademy.org/knowledge-center/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://monumentacademy.org/knowledge-center/">a section of its website</a> to providing information for those who do.</p>
// <p>One potential obstacle is financing. D.C.’s student funding formula is unusually generous. But before dismissing the idea of a therapeutic boarding school as unrealistic, authorities in other jurisdictions should take into account the steep costs of continuing to leave childhood trauma largely unaddressed.</p>`,

She had been working hard on education policy in Washington, and had served on the board of the local charter-school authorizer. But then she was suddenly given a front-row seat to the problems faced by kids who have had to be separated from their parents. The aunt and uncle of her husband took custody of their two grandchildren, after the mother and father’s parental rights had been terminated by a court. The grandparents, at their advanced age, weren’t sure they could manage full responsibility. But they knew the children needed someone to step up. So they did, and began seeking help from extended family and others. “This got me pretty obsessed” with the problems of children in foster care, says Bloomfield.</p>
// <p>She points out that this situation is becoming increasingly common, thanks to family breakdown and drug addiction. More and more grandparents and other family members are being asked to step in for incapable parents, and they need help from their communities.</p>
// <p>In her education-policy role, Bloomfield also saw a niche for a specialized school. Despite a thriving charter movement and a voucher program in D.C., foster youth still often found themselves without schooling options that matched their specific problems. So she founded a school just for them—a boarding school, where they live five days a week.</p>
// <p>The charter school Monument Academy started its third year of operation in 2017 and currently has a fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-grade class, with plans to add one more grade each year until it serves kids through high school. Bloomfield says that when it comes to this population, “a lot of money is being spent on failure. The outcomes are terrible.” But she is hoping that Monument can “provide a proof point” that there is a way to educate these children effectively.</p>
// <p>Lisa Bernstein, a member of Monument’s board and one of the early supporters of the school, made the same observation. Having been a coach and literacy teacher at various schools throughout the city, Bernstein tells me, “I had experienced personally that kid in your class who took up so much more energy and oxygen than all the other kids.” She remembers asking herself, “What can I do for this child? I am not enough.” Even “with the best-run schools and resources and the best principals, there is not enough bandwidth or programming or knowhow to address what these kids need.” As behavioral issues pile up, “their education slows down or pauses.”</p>
// <p>To tackle these deep challenges, Monument has adopted a more personalized system of learning, used smaller classrooms, and built “de-escalation spaces” where kids can go to calm down (with an adult) if their behavior veers out of control. The school provides intense mental-health counseling and has formed a partnership with Georgetown University to address physical-health concerns. “So many kids come in with little or no medical attention,” Bloomfield tells me. Undiagnosed asthma that causes difficulty in breathing. Untreated tooth infections. “One child was so upset he pulled a tooth right out of his head.”</p>
// <p>These problems, taken one at a time, can be addressed by a team of adults around a table. Monument works with each student’s foster parents—and biological parents if they are available. There is also an effort to work with caseworkers from family services, although current privacy laws make it difficult to share information between educators and caseworkers. (Another obstacle is D.C.’s very high turnover rate among caseworkers.) These challenges have led to Monument organizing more care “in-house.”</p>
// <p>Monument uses a house-parent model in which ten students live with two adults in a wing of the school building during the week, eating their meals together and learning discipline, mutual support, and life skills like doing the laundry and setting a table. “We want to show them that this is what it’s like to live in a stable, collaborative family structure.” And, says Bloomfield, “we can ensure that they get a good night’s sleep, decent food, and hygiene.”</p>
// <p>The boarding aspect of the program also addresses one of the biggest challenges for foster students—the frequency with which they move. As foster kids get transferred from home to home (sometimes back to their biological parent or simply between foster families) they are often forced to change schools. While many jurisdictions have legislation that allows a foster child to remain in the same school even if he or she moves outside of the neighborhood, this can be a logistical challenge if the school is too far away. Plus, many of the students who come to Monument have been expelled from previous schools.</p>
// <p>Even with a strong team of adults, it’s a roller-coaster ride. Within the first six weeks of Monument’s opening, five kids out of the class of 40 were hospitalized. Monument found beds for them “in a place that knew what they were doing.”  It got them stabilized, perhaps had their meds changed. “And then we got them back into the classroom.”</p>
// <h4><strong>There’s no place like school</strong></h4>
// <p>The school is spending more than $50,000 per child on average, including room and board. That’s almost three times the amount spent on the typical D.C. student. More than half of the students qualify for special-education services, so that drives up the per-pupil costs. But D.C. also has a fairly generous charter program that covers most of the cost (including the additional allocations for special ed). The rest is supplied by private philanthropy.</p>
// <p>Monument was launched with financial backing from the CityBridge Foundation, the family philanthropy of David and Katherine Bradley. CityBridge picked Monument as one of the winners of its competition for new schools and new-school models. It was looking for ideas that combined personalized learning with financial sustainability. Mieka Wick, CEO of CityBridge Education, a nonprofit the foundation started in 2017, tells me that the foundation was attracted to “an academic environment that will allow the teacher to be more of a coach and personalized partner.”</p>
// <p>CityBridge Education sees its mission as getting schools off the ground, not sustaining them indefinitely. One of the first issues addressed is real estate. “Finding a building is one of the biggest barriers,” says Wick. This is true of most charter schools, but schools that cater to foster kids feel this problem more acutely.</p>
// <p>Monument found an old D.C. public-school building, but it had to be renovated completely in order to make a separate space for the dormitories and de-escalation rooms. Schools for children with serious behavioral issues need a lot of space. Though Bloomfield is glad she found the building she did, she notes that there is not much outdoor space beyond a small courtyard. “These kids need to get out and run.”</p>
// <p>CityBridge does not pick up ongoing costs, and has instead focused on helping Bloomfield assemble a board that will contribute financially and in expertise. This is part of its role as “an angel investor.”</p>
// <p>Thanks to D.C.’s charter-school laws, about 93 percent of Monument’s costs are paid for by tax dollars. But the school has depended on private funding in order to make its environment more hospitable to students and to hire an appropriate amount of staff. There are also ambitions to provide more comprehensive health care.</p>
// <p>The chances of replicating the model of Monument in other states depend in significant part on charter funding laws. Arizona, Florida, and North Carolina all have voucher programs for kids in foster care. And last fall, Oklahoma expanded a program for special-needs kids to include foster children as well. The school has committed since its inception to sharing its plans and best practices openly. There is a “knowledge center” on the Monument website that offers information to people who want to start something like this in their own community. While Bloomfield does not see herself creating another Monument—she might consider adding grades below fifth at some point—she would like to add a residency program that would train principals and teachers who want to do something similar. Monument already hosts social workers who are looking to do some clinical hours for their training.</p>
// <h4><strong>No time like the present</strong></h4>
// <p>There seems to be a new national urgency to efforts like this. There are over 400,000 children in foster care, and some states, including California and West Virginia, have seen a large surge in this population connected to the opioid epidemic.</p>
// <p>Many foster children face chilling futures. According to the National Foster Youth Institute, one fifth of the 23,000 foster children who reach age 18 each year have nowhere to live. Only half will find gainful employment by the time they are 24. There is only a 3 percent chance they will earn a college degree. One recent survey showed 14 percent of prison inmates in California had at one point spent time in foster care. All of this costs society a significant amount of money—an average lifetime cost of up to $300,000 for individuals who age out of the system.</p>
// <p>New efforts to head off these costs and human heartaches have been launched in several cities. Haven Academy, a charter school for kids who are or have been in foster care, was established ten years ago by the New York Foundling, a 150-year-old Catholic charity that helps children in need, and expanded this fall to include a new middle school. Around the same time, Philadelphia became home to Arise Charter School focused on foster kids, which in 2015 converted to a private school called C.B. Community. Optimist Charter School in Los Angeles opened in 2013 to serve probation and foster youth. A school called Da Vinci RISE High in Los Angeles was one of ten schools in 2017 to win a Super School grant, a contest funded by Laurene Powell Jobs.</p>
// <p>The RISE school started small—serving 30 students on one campus—but it will eventually grow to 500 students. The plan is to offer personalized learning to students who are moved along as they demonstrate mastery of their subjects, instead of the traditional movement through age-based grades. A project-based curriculum will focus students on real-world experiences, and internships and other practical experiences will provide a way of earning course credits.</p>
// <p>Another project in the works is Sisu Academy, dreamt up by a former homeless kid himself. With an absent father and mentally ill mother, Jabez LeBret relied on friends for places to stay throughout high school, and teachers and counselors for support. Despite their best efforts, he did not graduate. “The system wasn’t set up to manage my situation,” LeBret says.</p>
// <p>But his story wasn’t over yet. He beat the odds and earned his GED, and then a college degree. He eventually launched a successful career in marketing. All the while he was trying to help kids who were like him—homeless, in foster care, or otherwise at risk.</p>
// <p>“I can speak firsthand to what it’s like to be in a new home every two or three weeks. It creates constant stress and uncertainty.” What these children needed, he realized, was a place just for them—one that would help them “develop important life skills.”</p>
// <p>So LeBret is working on a boarding school in San Diego. He cites programs like Wasatch Academy in Utah (where boarded students work on a farm) and the Milton Hershey School in Pennsylvania (which has long educated orphans and poor children) as models for his proposed Sisu Academy. He envisions two business incubators and a working farm, and chances for kids to start their own business ventures that could ultimately provide some revenue flow for the school. His goal is for Sisu to be tuition-free. To that end, he’s secured corporate in-kind donations of furniture and software, and he is working on raising $16 million to welcome its first class of 80 students.</p>
// <p>But residential schools are not the best option for every child, and experts in the field recommend keeping most foster children close to their biological or foster parents. A child entirely removed from his or her extended family or community is often more vulnerable to disorientation and abuse. And LeBret says “there is a direct correlation between the distance from family and the rates of foster-care kids going AWOL and disengaging from the system.”</p>
// <p>But for children in extremely disorganized or dysfunctional families, a boarding school can be a saving grace. If the combination of a stable home and a decent education are the main predictors of adult success, then schools that offer these two things have a chance of dramatically improving life for some foster children, especially if they can expose the youngsters to a consistent group of adults who will care for them outside the classroom. Partial boarding also offers a respite for caretakers of these children, who are often under tremendous pressure.</p>
// <p>A few years ago, some researchers at the University of Rochester revisited the famous “marshmallow test,” which evaluates a child’s ability to wait for a larger reward instead of grasping for a quick payoff. They determined that it was not simply some innate ability to delay gratification that allowed some children to wait. It turned out that the kids who came from homes where they had reliable adults, adults who delivered on their promises, were the most likely to succeed at the test. Children who came from environments where adults were constantly letting them down actually made a rational choice by grabbing resources quickly and running—because who knows if the offerer will really come back and fulfill the promise?</p>
// <p>Bloomfield says it is these students who need places like Monument the most. “They live in a constant state of anxiety and watchfulness. Their lives are full of unpredictability. They keep experiencing loss.” Bloomfield hopes to give these students the social and academic tools they need to rebuild their lives on more stable ground. She doesn’t promise miracles, just improvement. “We can provide respite.”</p>
// <h4><strong> </strong><strong>College Camp for Foster Kids</strong></h4>
// <p>Another more-than-academic effort to intervene in the lives of foster children is called First Star, which runs summer programs on college campuses for adolescents in foster care.</p>
// <p>The First Star program of South Jersey, supported by the Pascale Sykes Foundation, is now in its third year, with about 30 tenth- and eleventh-graders spending several weeks each summer at Rowan University. There students take at least one college-level class for course credit in addition to learning their way around a campus. Students also participate in a year-round program that meets every couple of weeks, where they receive tutoring for the SAT, advice about college applications, and the opportunity to work on group projects, like creating a robot or a radio program. Students also make group visits to colleges.</p>
// <p>Participants, foster parents, and family members where possible have to agree to the program’s requirements. Families must develop a long-term plan for students in cooperation with First Star. Law students from Rutgers volunteer with the program to ensure that students are getting the right services and supports at home. First Star staff say that the students are better behaved both at school and at home when they are in the program.</p>
// <p>The Pascale Sykes Foundation is spending a little less than $10,000 per child per year. Other donors include Give Something Back, led by Robert Carr. It offers participants four-year-college scholarships to several institutions in New Jersey, as long as they maintain a B average and are of good character.</p>
// <p>Frances Sykes says her foundation “is always focused on family as the primary determinant of the physical and emotional wellbeing of a child.” Its insistence on involving foster parents, not just kids, has influenced other First Star branches to do more to incorporate the family in their interventions.</p>`,

//       },
//       content: `<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he students at Monument Academy get two lessons in every class: academic and emotional.</p>
// <p>One August day early in the school year, a seventh-grade English class lesson, on how the setting of a novel affects character development, came with a side of gratitude and empathy.</p>
// <p>“Stuff doesn’t define your character, actions do,” DaShawn, one of the students, said, summing up the lesson on being kind to others who don’t have the same material advantages, taught by one of what’s known here as well-being coaches who give “positive action lessons” every day before the teachers take over.</p>
// <p>That type of social-emotional learning is key at Monument Academy, a charter school in its third year, serving 127 children in fifth through seventh grades, most of whom have touched D.C.’s foster care system. The students live on campus from Sunday evening through Friday afternoon with house parents, a setup that provides essential life skills and helps them form the bonds with caring adults that are key to long-term success.</p>
// <p>Emily Bloomfield, the school’s CEO and co-founder, was inspired to start Monument both by her work in education reform, including as a member of D.C.’s Public Charter School Board, and how the issue of children without caregivers had played out in her own family. Bloomfield said her young relatives in California were facing a lifetime in the foster care system when their grandparents had to weigh their own health concerns and diminished financial resources with the need to take them in.</p>
// <p>Bloomfield looked at the statistics and was horrified: Students in the foster care system move one and a half to two times a year, ripping up relationships with friends and teachers; they’re twice as likely to drop out of high school; and only 2 percent earn a four-year college degree.</p>
// <p>“Not only can we not have that for our own family, but it shouldn’t be the outcome for any child,” Bloomfield said during a visit by The 74 and the National Alliance of Public Charter Schools in mid-August, already the second week of school at Monument, which has only a six-week summer break.</p>
// <p>There were 2,454 children under the supervision of D.C.’s Child and Family Services Agency as of Sept. 21. They’re split between the 905 children in foster care and the 1,549 being monitored by the agency while still at home with their parents. Nearly all of Monument’s students, 85 percent, have come in contact with the foster care system.</p>
// <p>Bloomfield dug into research to find out what does work for children in foster care, and found out that an excellent, personalized education and relationship with a caring adult were essential, as were life skills that children in foster care often miss, from cooking and cleaning to the financial skills necessary to prevent <a href="http://www.fosterfocusmag.com/articles/foster-care-and-homelessness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homelessness</a>.</p>
// <p>A boarding system allowed all of that to come together. Students live in single-sex houses of no more than 10 children with house parents, usually a married couple, some of whom have their own children and pets who also live on campus.</p>
// <p>“The boarding component was so important to this because it anchors so much of this work, the relationship builds other pieces. The other reason it’s so important is we have adults in this building who are talking to each other day and night about the student and the student’s needs,” Bloomfield said.</p>
// <p>That caring adult makes all the difference, said Sharyl Dormus, the head of student life.</p>
// <p>“A student walks through the halls of Monument Academy knowing that they’re loved and cared for, knowing that they belong and that they have that foundation behind them in anything they’re going to do, that makes all the difference in the world,” Dormus said.</p>
// <p>Jeanne Peacock Davis had some hesitations about sending her grandson Elijah Miller to live at Monument as a fifth-grader because he was so young, but felt better after meeting his first set of house parents, she said.</p>
// <p>“I began to loosen up and felt he’s going to be OK. The environment was so different than D.C. public schools that once I started coming here, seeing how things were going, I said ‘Oh, he’s going to do well.’ He has done exceptionally well here. I’ve seen a big turnaround,” she said.</p>
// <p>Elijah “has had some trauma in his life,” and Monument has helped him deal with that, she said.</p>
// <p>Charles W., a seventh-grader at the school, said sometimes he misses his family but living at Monument is better than staying at his mom’s house; his brother goes to Monument, too. (School officials asked The 74 to use first names only for some students because of privacy concerns surrounding the child welfare system.)</p>
// <p>“I like the atmosphere,” Charles said. He particularly likes his house’s trips to local stores, and the students in his house often help each other with chores, he said.</p>
// <p>There were few examples of schools specifically serving children in foster care or in a residential environment for Bloomfield to look to.</p>
// <p>One of the few was the <a href="http://www.mhskids.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milton Hershey School</a> in central Pennsylvania. It was founded a century ago by the famed chocolatier to educate orphaned boys. Now co-ed, it’s still funded by a trust started with his personal fortune, and currently serves more than 2,000 low-income pre-K-12 students  from across the country. Leaders there provided invaluable help, Bloomfield said, including lending the school a pair of experienced house parents for Monument’s first year — and covering their salary.</p>
// <p>But by and large, “there’s no road map. We are building the highways right now,” she said.</p>
// <p>In terms of academics, students come into the fifth-through-seventh-grades school anywhere from on grade level to as far behind as kindergarten or first grade, she said. A little more than half of the students have special education needs.</p>
// <p>But teachers at Monument set high expectations for their students, emphasizing that they believe they can do the work — something many haven’t experienced.</p>
// <p>“What they’ve heard is they’re failures, they’re bad, they’re not worthy, and they carry so much of that anyway from their own personal experience, loss and rejection, that school can become this other pile-on factor of loss and rejection that builds the narrative,” she said.</p>
// <p>It can be hard for teachers, too.</p>
// <p>Ogo Nwaneri, the teacher of the seventh-grade English class, said when she first started at Monument, she felt like she couldn’t do it, despite several years’ teaching experience in Baltimore.</p>
// <p>Now, though, she and her husband have become house parents in addition to her teaching job, an opportunity that she says lets her work with the students in a less pressure-filled environment than the usual 80-minute academic block.</p>
// <p>Monument is located in the former Gibbs Elementary School in Northeast Washington, a D.C. public school that closed several years ago. Student housing is in a different wing of the three-story red brick building from classrooms; each “house” is more like an apartment, with several shared bedrooms for students, a communal kitchen and living room, shared bathrooms for the students, and a private bedroom and bathroom suite for the house parents.</p>
// <p>“I always say that this job teaches me more than I think I teach the kids,” Nwaneri said.</p>
// <p>The school had to be a charter to work, Bloomfield said. Beyond the per-pupil education expenditures, D.C. provides additional funding to schools that also house students; Monument also solicits philanthropic dollars.</p>
// <p>Autonomy and the ability to make decisions very quickly “is absolutely vital to our success,” she said.</p>
// <p>Success for Monument’s students often involves a lot of quick changes in schedules, spaces, and the way staff do their work that “when you’re in a bigger system, it’s just really hard to do,” she said.</p>
// <p>School leaders, who will add an eighth grade next year and hope to expand to high school after that, have learned a lot since they started three years ago, including what has become “blindingly obvious” — the importance of trusting relationships between adults and students.</p>
// <p>“Building those relationships is the foundation on which you can then move forward,” Bloomfield said.</p>`,

// <p dir="ltr">The founding Monument Academy teachers and staff knew that running a 24-hour school for children who’ve survived trauma and violence would be difficult.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">They just didn’t know how difficult.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">“It was chaotic,” said Emily Bloomfield, the school’s founder and CEO, recalling the first few weeks of class last summer. “There was a lot of fighting &#8230; a lot of cursing, a lot of running around.”</p>
// <p dir="ltr">The 40 fifth-graders who started in August at this unusual new charter school in northeast Washington include children in foster care or at risk of entering the foster-care system. Some live in homeless shelters. Some have seen or experienced domestic violence or abuse. Some have grieved painful losses. And some have changed schools or been suspended or expelled so many times that they’re significantly behind their peers, both academically and emotionally.</p>
// <div class="blah">
// <div class="l-article__container__container">
// <section id="article-section-0" class="l-article__section s-cms-content">

// <p dir="ltr">When the students moved into their new “home,” their fragile emotions collided, staffers said.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">“They fed off each other,” Bloomfield recalled. “There were a couple of kids who were really in crisis and when you have a child in crisis, and by that I mean, really, totally unregulated, melting down, behaving very dangerously, it’s a trigger for many other kids and their anxiety level goes up and their behavior goes up.”</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Furniture went flying. Fights broke out. Police were called and ambulances were summoned to take kids to psychiatric hospitals. One child who had been accustomed to roaming the streets alone at night brought a fake gun to school for protection. And some staffers started to wonder if they would find a way to make it work.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">But Monument’s founders had designed a secondary school that will eventually educate fifth- through 12th-graders using every tool they could find that’s been proven to work for kids who’ve experienced trauma. They scheduled yoga and meditation classes in the daily curriculum. They hired as many therapists as teachers—four of each—to take on the serious mental health issues that went largely neglected in students’ previous schools. And, most significantly, they took advantage of an unusual quirk in Washington, D.C.’s education law that offers extra funding to schools that provide housing to their students.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">That makes this school extremely unusual in American education: It’s a free, urban public boarding school for kids who need extra attention.</p>
// <div class="blah">

// <p dir="ltr">Urban public boarding schools themselves are not new.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">The SEED School in Washington opened in 1998 to give kids from struggling neighborhoods access to the kind of rigorous college prep boarding schools that were once available only to the nation’s wealthiest families.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">SEED has generated controversy for its expensive model. It spends <a href="http://www.dcfpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/8.5.15-Revenue-and-Spending-Per-Student-TP-Final.pdf" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'">about three times more per pupil</a> than a typical Washington charter school. The school has also been criticized for a high attrition rate since last year’s graduating class of 29 was much smaller than the 80 students who won the lottery seven years earlier to enter the rigorous “no excuses” sixth-through-12th-grade program. Students transferred to other schools for a variety of reasons, the school said.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">But SEED has clearly gotten results. A 2012 <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/potential-urban-boarding-schools-poor-evidence-seed" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'">study</a> by the Harvard economist Roland Fryer compared students who were admitted to the school through its annual lottery to those who applied but didn’t get in. The study found that admitted kids not only had significantly higher math and reading scores, they also seemed to have better life prospects—a 3.8 percent increase in future earnings for every year spent at SEED, 1 to 1.3 percent decrease in the probability that the child will commit a crime, and a 4.4 percent decrease in the likelihood of the child developing a health disability.</p>

// <p dir="ltr">“Urban boarding schools are expensive,” the study concludes, but the “implied benefits are enormous.”</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Fryer cautions, however, that the school’s oldest students are still too young to draw conclusions about whether SEED’s impact will affect students’ lives into adulthood. “Whether or not the total benefits of attending SEED outweigh the costs can be known with the passage of time,” he wrote.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">SEED has been featured on “60 Minutes,” visited by President Obama, and celebrated in the movie <em>Waiting for Superman</em>. It opened a second campus in Baltimore for students from across Maryland in 2008.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Now, the newest urban public boarding schools—including Monument and the latest SEED campus in Miami—seem to be taking the model a step further, using the round-the-clock structure to serve even needier children.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Monument is specifically gearing its curriculum to children in foster care and those who are trauma survivors while SEED-Miami is required by Florida law to set aside a third of its seats for children who’ve received services from the child-welfare system. Students can’t even apply to SEED-Miami unless they fall into <a href="http://www.miami.seedschool.org/enroll#2" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'">one of five categories</a> of children who have traditionally struggled to graduate. That includes foster youth, children with incarcerated parents, and kids whose families receive public housing assistance.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Eric Adler, one of SEED’s founders, said the unusual admissions criteria were spelled out in the <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/1002.3305" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'">Florida law</a> that established the Miami school, but he stressed that students in Miami are not significantly different from those in Washington or Baltimore.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">SEED has always served kids facing serious challenges—as should any school with such a high price tag, Adler said. “What would be the point of lavishing these resources in [wealthy] upper northwest Washington?” he asked. “We are aiming to deploy these resources on kids for whom we believe they will make the most difference.”</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Bloomfield said she was inspired to create the Monument Academy after trying to help some relatives who had taken custody of two grandchildren with learning and emotional challenges. The relatives weren’t sure they could care for the children but when Bloomfield started looking into what might happen to them if they entered the foster system, she found alarming <a href="http://www.cacollegepathways.org/sites/default/files/datasheet_jan_2014_update.pdf" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'">statistics</a>: Roughly half of foster youth don’t graduate from high school, only 20 percent enroll in college, and just <a href="http://www.chapinhall.org/sites/default/files/Midwest%20Evaluation_Report_4_10_12.pdf" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'">2 to 4 percent</a> earn a college degree by age 26.

// <p dir="ltr">Though Bloomfield served on a school board in California and was on Washington D.C.’s public charter-school board, she had never considered starting her own school, she said. Her background is in economics and public administration but the more she learned about what helps foster youth beat those overwhelming odds—things like a stable, quality education and the presence of caring, consistent adults—the more she wanted to build a school that would serve the needs of these neediest kids.</p>

// <p dir="ltr">Experts on treating children with emotional issues will be watching closely to see if a public boarding-school model is something that could work in other districts to help foster youth, homeless kids, and other trauma survivors.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Some experts, like Susan Cole, the director of the Trauma and Learning Policy Initiative, will be watching very skeptically. “I know it’s well meant but it does raise concern that we may be harkening back to the old days when ‘troubled kids’ were sent to special homes or schools and excluded from mainstream classrooms,” said Cole, whose organization advocates for children who’ve endured difficult circumstances.</p>
// <p dir="ltr"><a href="http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=482289" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'">Some studies have show</a>n that as many as two-thirds of American children in a random sample group experienced at least one traumatic event by age 16, and 13 percent experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.  Cole worries that if schools like Monument and SEED-Miami proliferate, it might give typical schools an excuse to neglect students who’ve endured personal challenges.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">“It could be great when done well but it could also send a message to some schools that says: ‘You don’t have to have supports and services for students in foster care or homeless students. You can send them away,’” Cole said.  “That would be very troubling.”</p>
// <p dir="ltr">But Bloomfield and her crew say typical schools are stretched too thin to give kids like their students the help they need. “I don’t think it’s because they don’t care. I’ve worked in those schools, too,” said Monument’s principal, Marlene Magrino. “It’s that they don’t have the resources. They weren’t built and structured around providing resources for that particular student or multiple students who are in that space.”</p>
// <p dir="ltr">In many districts across the country, kids with difficult home lives act out in school and are treated as <a href="http://www.nancyrappaport.com/files/Rappaport%20Aug%202006.pdf" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'">discipline problems</a>. They’re suspended, expelled, or banished to a special-education classroom where they won’t disrupt mainstream kids.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">“Many children who end up getting into disciplinary problems &#8230; are kids who have a significant history of adverse childhood experience and resulting trauma,” said Christopher Blodgett, whose CLEAR Trauma Center at Washington State University works with schools to help them respond more sensitively to children recovering from trauma.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">In some cases, when behavior becomes extreme, communities set up residential treatment programs where children are assigned by the criminal-justice or social-service systems. San Diego County in California opened what it calls the nation’s first residential education campus for foster youth in 2001. The San Pasqual Academy is part school and part foster-care group home.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">But Monument is not a treatment facility or group home. No one is assigned to the school or placed there by social workers. Kids live with their parents or guardians on the weekend and at school the rest of the week.</p>

// <p dir="ltr">Bloomfield recruited this year’s applicants by spreading the word to social-service agencies, homeless shelters, and organizations that work with high-risk kids and, as is required of all Washington charter schools, used a lottery for admissions.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Then, she applied TLC.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">“At any school that I’ve worked in except for this one, my students have been the bad kids or the stupid kids, and that’s kind of how the whole school community views them,” said Julia Ellis, Monument’s special-education teacher. “That is not happening here &#8230; These are the students that need the most love, and I think this is the place that gives them the most love.”</p>
// <p dir="ltr">In designing Monument, Magrino and Bloomfield said they’ve been careful to avoid the pitfalls of some of history’s failed special-education schools—the ones that isolated so-called “troubled kids.”</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Magrino cited studies that suggest that putting kids with emotional issues in segregated schools or classrooms can create problems. The students tend to clash with each other and lack the positive role models they would find in mainstream classrooms.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">“Putting all these kids in the same school or in the same class without appropriate skill building or supports is absolutely a bad idea because there’s nobody modeling what you should be doing and nobody filling in gaps in skills,” Magrino said. “The difference here is we have a well-being team that’s the same size as our teaching team and every kid’s getting therapy. We have positive action every day where they’re being taught explicitly social and emotional skills. We have them living here to stabilize some of what goes on in the evening and we have exceptional, really small classes &#8230; We’ve built the school on research around what helps kids become independent and successful.”</p>
// <p dir="ltr">A few months after opening, the school still is struggling with behavior issues.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Recently in a science and math class, two teachers spent the first 30 minutes trying to settle the class as one girl wrote on her arm, another pulled her desk down into her lap, a third shoved construction paper cards she’d made for her boyfriend under the door into the hallway, and a fourth stood on a sofa doing a dance move that resembled twerking.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">The teachers refused to start class until every student—they were all girls since the school is experimenting with separating sexes in most classrooms to reduce conflicts—had written an apology to me (a reporter) and an administrator who were watching the class.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">One student apologized “for acting like im a animal,” spelling that last word “anmial,” and decorating the note with a picture of a dog. (Apology letters are a common form of discipline at the school since they help focus kids on the fact that others are affected by their behavior.)</p>
// <p dir="ltr">But despite tough mornings like that, staffers say they see progress.</p>

// <p dir="ltr">When one boy cussed out Magrino, the principal, later that day and ran to the door during a house meeting, she called this an improvement. A few weeks earlier that boy would have knocked over furniture and left the room, she said. This time, he stood at the door, simmering, until he was able to control his rage and come back to the group.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">“That was a win,” Magrino said later.</p>

// <p dir="ltr">At Monument, students live together in brightly painted apartments from Sunday night until Friday evening.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">The additional time provided by the 24-hour model lets the school push some activities—like health class—into student homes at night so there’s more time during the day for academics and therapeutic interventions. Some students also receive therapy or counseling during evening hours.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">The boarding model also provides more consistency and stability, making it worth the extra costs, Bloomfield said. Her school received a $400,000 startup grant from Next Generation Learning Challenges, she added, which supports school innovation, and $250,000 from the Walton Family Foundation, a grant that will help hire additional staff now to prepare for the school’s expansion to sixth grade next year, then seventh the year after.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">The school is also raising funds to help cover the cost of reconfiguring the former Washington public school into a campus with classrooms on one side, apartments on the other, and a recreation area on the roof.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Going forward, Bloomfield says she expects to spend roughly $48,000 per student per year. That’s about <a href="http://www.dcfpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/8.5.15-Revenue-and-Spending-Per-Student-TP-Final.pdf" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'">three times more</a> than typical Washington charter schools, but her school gets more money from the district because 55 percent of its students receive special-education services.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">The expense is why schools like Monument and SEED aren’t likely to expand quickly across the country. Efforts by educators and advocates in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/27/buffalo-public-boarding-schools_n_7152716.html" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'">Buffalo</a>, <a href="http://bridgemi.com/2015/04/could-a-public-boarding-school-model-work-in-detroit/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'">Detroit</a>, <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-03-14/news/0803140148_1_seed-school-chicago-public-schools-year-round" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'">Chicago</a>, and other cities to create public boarding schools haven’t moved much beyond the idea stage.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Advocates in Ohio went so far as to get <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3328" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'">state laws</a> changed to open a SEED campus in Cincinnati or Cleveland but funding and politics have so far failed to come together.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">Still, Adler says he continues to hope that schools like his—which supporters say save money in the long run since graduates become taxpayers instead of criminals or welfare recipients—will someday open in every city in the country. “It works and it changes lives,” he said.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">At Monument, students learn to cook and set the table in apartments called “houses,” where bunk beds are separated from the living room by a series of sliding doors. Students have long lists of chores—scrubbing toilets, making beds, mopping up—and gather as a family for breakfast, saying a blessing before digging into their oatmeal and tea. At dinner, the students in one of Monument’s four houses write what they’re thankful for on colorful strips of paper and put them in a jar. Students are graded on how they behave at home as well as in the classroom but they have fun too, they say.</p>

// <p dir="ltr">“Last night we watched a movie, ate popcorn, and we was over with our stuffed animals playing games,” one 11-year-old girl told me during a visit to the school in November.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">That girl, who the school asked not to identify by name, lives in the Monument house supervised by houseparents Paul and Joy Langmaid. The Langmaids’ house includes 10 girls, the couple’s own infant daughter, and a friendly golden retriever named Midas. The girls vie for the daily “No Drama Queen” award that gives them the right to hold Midas’ leash when the house heads to the other side of the school each morning to exercise in the gym before class. The “No Drama Queen” winner also gets to select music for the house’s morning dance party, and anyone who wins three days in a row will get a pedicure and foot massage from Joy Langmaid. The award goes to the girl who best distinguishes herself in class and at home—one of many ways the living and learning environments are intertwined here.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">“We’ve seen a lot of growth in the kids. The beds are relatively made. They’re waking up on time,” said Paul Langmaid, 33, who, with his wife, previously worked as a houseparent at the Milton Hershey School in Pennsylvania.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">The wealthy Hershey School, a free private boarding school for low-income students, is one of the schools Bloomfield visited as she prepared to open Monument—but it’s hard to apply the lessons of a private school with a $9 billion endowment to a public urban start-up. Houseparents here don’t have the extensive support system they have in Hershey, Paul Langmaid said, but Monument is starting to show some results. “You can go through school now and there’s kids not running all over in the hall,” Langmaid said.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">The Hershey school has been supportive of Monument. The storied academy even sent two of its longtime employees, Karen and Allen Brown, to work at Monument for a year while on Hershey’s payroll. The couple, both 59, are pitching in however they can, from filling in as houseparents to preparing food and fixing doors. “I was very shocked by the violence and outbursts we saw in the beginning,” Karen Brown said. “But it’s gotten much better as the kids have gotten consistency and gotten used to it.”</p>
// <p dir="ltr">The school has a long way to go before it provides the kind of stable education that a well-resourced school like Hershey does, but if Bloomfield and her crew can figure out a way to help their students on a public school budget, they might be on to something, Allen Brown said.</p>
// <p dir="ltr">In seven years, the Browns say they hope to come back and proudly watch this year’s fifth-graders accept their diplomas and get ready to move on to college or careers. The school plans to add a grade every year until this year’s inaugural class reaches graduation.</p>
// <p>“Sometimes I look at these kids and I hear some of their stories and I feel like Emily Bloomfield is kind of Santa Claus,” Allen Brown said. “She’s landed on the island of misfit toys to help them. It’s a very challenging task to bring these kids up to that place where they need to be &#8230; but there are dedicated people, doing hard work.”</p>
