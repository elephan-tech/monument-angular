    Our family-style boarding program is one of the most distinctive elements of
    our school model, providing students with 24/7 supports throughout the
    school week.

  <h3>Family-style Boarding</h3>

  <p>
    Students board at Monument Academy from Sunday evening through to Friday
    afternoon. They live in small, family-style single gender homes. There are
    two Houseparents who live on campus for each home of 10 students. There is
    also a Director of Student Life who lives on campus and supervises the
    Houseparents, and a Resident Assistant who is awake and on duty through the
    night.
  </p>
  <p>
    The student homes include bedrooms and bathrooms for the students, a
    separate suite for Houseparents, and a common living and dining/kitchen
    area. Each home is decorated in a unique way and students have the
    opportunity to personalize their living space.
  </p>
  <h3>Schedule and Activities</h3>

  <p>
    In the morning, students and their Houseparents together prepare their
    morning meal and set goals before students head to class. In the afternoon,
    Houseparents greet students after their on-campus afternoon enrichment
    activities. They prepare and eat dinner together family-style, before
    evening reading homework and activities. These activities might include
    community meetings, board games or a movie night. Houseparents also teach
    students basic life skills, such as meal preparation, nutrition, how to take
    care of their home and do laundry.
  </p>
  <h3>Student Safety</h3>

  <p>
    Safety is always paramount. With our low ratio of students to Houseparents
    we are able to provide a high degree of supervision. In addition, our
    Houseparents are trained in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and
    Therapeutic Crisis Intervention (TCI). There is a social worker on duty
    through the evening hours to provide extra support to students and staff.
