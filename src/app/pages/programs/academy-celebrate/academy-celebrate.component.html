    In December, Monument Academy celebrated all that we accomplished in 2023 and announced our
    Teacher of the Year and Staff Member of the Year at our 2nd annual Monumental Achievement Gala!
    These awards are given to individuals who exemplify what it means to be present and engaged and
    go above and beyond for our school and students. We are excited to announce our winners, Pushaen
    Gunasinghe and Shoshanna Gleaton, and are so grateful for their contributions to the Monument
    Academy community! Congratulations!

    After awards were presented, a celebration ensued at the Watergate among Monument Academy staff,
    board members, supporters, community partners, family, and friends!
